# Built to Last

A Domain-Driven approach to beautiful systems

## Abstract

Help! Despite following refactoring patterns by the book, your aging codebase is messier than ever. If only you had a key architectural insight to cut through the noise.

Today, we'll move beyond prescriptive recipes and learn how to run a Context Mapping exercise. This strategic design tool helps you discover domain-specific system boundaries, leading to highly-cohesive and loosely-coupled outcomes.

With code samples from real production code, we'll look at a domain-oriented approach to organizing code in a Rails codebase, applying incremental refactoring steps to build stable, lasting systems!

## Build it

    $ ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080
